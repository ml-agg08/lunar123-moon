To manually annotate boulders and landslides from Chandrayaan‑2 top-down images, start by looking for any object with a clear shadow and sharp edge. These are usually boulders and typically range from a few meters to around 30 meters in size. Once spotted, draw a bounding box around the object. To classify each boulder, focus on its most obvious visual characteristic. For example, if it has a bright outer ring and a dark center pit, it’s called a cavity. A thin ledge peeling off the top surface indicates a flat spall. If you see jagged cracks that stop partway through the rock, it's a jagged fracture. If the boulder has a clear “X” or cross-shaped split running through it, it’s classified as an axial fracture. A tall, steep face on one side with a deep shadow below means it’s a vertical spall. If the rock appears to be sliced diagonally, with parts slightly shifted, that’s a shear fracture.

Next, look at the shape of the entire block. If there are circular cracks forming rings around a center, that’s a concentric fracture. If there’s a single large central piece surrounded by smaller ones, label it as a core. If all fragments are about the same size with no center block, it's a no-core structure. If sharp spikes or fragments seem to radiate outward from a central point, it’s a cone-type block. A dense pile of many small pieces, without any obvious pattern, is a cluster.

Now examine surface-level features. A very bright or shiny spot on the boulder surface suggests a freshly broken area and is called a bright zone. Flat, slab-like pieces with thin shadows are plate-like fragments. If a rock looks partially sunk into the ground, showing only the top, it’s partially buried. A rock with a grainy, salt-and-pepper appearance is classified as breccia. Finally, if you see a large area scattered with many small to medium boulders—especially near crater rims or slopes—that’s a boulder field.

For landslides, look for three main features along a slope: first, a steep, fresh-looking lip at the top (called the headscarp); second, a narrow, smooth, or streaky area running down the slope (this is the track); and third, a lumpy, disturbed pile of material at the bottom (this is the toe). If you see all three, draw a box around the full area and tag it as a landslide.

By using this approach—spotting sharp-edged rocks, identifying the most obvious feature, and tagging accordingly—you’ll be able to annotate lunar boulders and landslides quickly and consistently.
